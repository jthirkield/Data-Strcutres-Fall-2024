Something have you heard\\nOf Hamlet's transformation; so call it,\\nSith nor the exterior nor the inward man\\nResembles that it was. What it should be,\\nMore than his father's death, that thus hath put him\\nSo much from the understanding of himself,\\nI cannot dream of: I entreat you both,\\nThat, being of so young days brought up with him,\\nAnd sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,\\nThat you vouchsafe your rest here in our court\\nSome little time: so by your companies\\nTo draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,\\nSo much as from occasion you may glean,\\nWhether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,\\nThat, open'd, lies within our remedy.\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nGood gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;\\nAnd sure I am two men there are not living\\nTo whom he more adheres. If it will please you\\nTo show us so much gentry and good will\\nAs to expend your time with us awhile,\\nFor the supply and profit of our hope,\\nYour visitation shall receive such thanks\\nAs fits a king's remembrance.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nBoth your majesties\\nMight, by the sovereign power you have of us,\\nPut your dread pleasures more into command\\nThan to entreaty.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nBut we both obey,\\nAnd here give up ourselves, in the full bent\\nTo lay our service freely at your feet,\\nTo be commanded.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nThanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nThanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:\\nAnd I beseech you instantly to visit\\nMy too much changed son. Go, some of you,\\nAnd bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nHeavens make our presence and our practises\\nPleasant and helpful to him!\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nAy, amen!\\nExeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants\\n\\nEnter POLONIUS\\n\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nThe ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,\\nAre joyfully return'd.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nThou still hast been the father of good news.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nHave I, my lord?

Perpend.\\nI have a daughter--have while she is mine--\\nWho, in her duty and obedience, mark,\\nHath given me this: now gather, and surmise.\\nReads\\n\\n'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most\\nbeautified Ophelia,'--\\nThat's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is\\na vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:\\nReads\\n\\n'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nCame this from Hamlet to her?\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nGood madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.\\nReads\\n\\n'Doubt thou the stars are fire;\\nDoubt that the sun doth move;\\nDoubt truth to be a liar;\\nBut never doubt I love.\\n'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;\\nI have not art to reckon my groans: but that\\nI love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.\\n'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst\\nthis machine is to him, HAMLET.'\\nThis, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,\\nAnd more above, hath his solicitings,\\nAs they fell out by time, by means and place,\\nAll given to mine ear.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nBut how hath she\\nReceived his love?\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nWhat do you think of me?\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nAs of a man faithful and honourable.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nI would fain prove so. But what might you think,\\nWhen I had seen this hot love on the wing--\\nAs I perceived it, I must tell you that,\\nBefore my daughter told me--what might you,\\nOr my dear majesty your queen here, think,\\nIf I had play'd the desk or table-book,\\nOr given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,\\nOr look'd upon this love with idle sight;\\nWhat might you think? No, I went round to work,\\nAnd my young mistress thus I did bespeak:\\n'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;\\nThis must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,\\nThat she should lock herself from his resort,\\nAdmit no messengers, receive no tokens.\\nWhich done, she took the fruits of my advice;\\nAnd he, repulsed--a short tale to make--\\nFell into a sadness, then into a fast,\\nThence to a watch, thence into a weakness,\\nThence to a lightness, and, by this declension,\\nInto the madness wherein now he raves,\\nAnd all we mourn for.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nDo you think 'tis this?\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nIt may be, very likely.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nHath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--\\nThat I have positively said 'Tis so,'\\nWhen it proved otherwise?\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nNot that I know.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\n[Pointing to his head and shoulder]\\nTake this from this, if this be otherwise:\\nIf circumstances lead me, I will find\\nWhere truth is hid, though it were hid indeed\\nWithin the centre.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nHow may we try it further?\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nYou know, sometimes he walks four hours together\\nHere in the lobby.\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nSo he does indeed.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nAt such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:\\nBe you and I behind an arras then;\\nMark the encounter: if he love her not\\nAnd be not from his reason fall'n thereon,\\nLet me be no assistant for a state,\\nBut keep a farm and carters.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nWe will try it.\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nBut, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nAway, I do beseech you, both away:\\nI'll board him presently.\\nExeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants\\n\\nEnter HAMLET, reading\\n\\nO, give me leave:\\nHow does my good Lord Hamlet?\\nHAMLET\\nWell, God-a-mercy.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nDo you know me, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nExcellent well; you are a fishmonger.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nNot I, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nThen I would you were so honest a man.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nHonest, my lord!\\nHAMLET\\nAy, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be\\none man picked out of ten thousand.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nThat's very true, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nFor if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a\\ngod kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nI have, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nLet her not walk i' the sun: conception is a\\nblessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.\\nFriend, look to 't.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\n[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my\\ndaughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I\\nwas a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and\\ntruly in my youth I suffered much extremity for\\nlove; very near this. I'll speak to him again.\\nWhat do you read, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nWords, words, words.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nWhat is the matter, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nBetween who?\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nI mean, the matter that you read, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nSlanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here\\nthat old men have grey beards, that their faces are\\nwrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and\\nplum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of\\nwit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,\\nthough I most powerfully and potently believe, yet\\nI hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for\\nyourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab\\nyou could go backward.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\n[Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method\\nin 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nInto my grave.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nIndeed, that is out o' the air.\\nAside\\n\\nHow pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness\\nthat often madness hits on, which reason and sanity\\ncould not so prosperously be delivered of. I will\\nleave him, and suddenly contrive the means of\\nmeeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable\\nlord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.\\nHAMLET\\nYou cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will\\nmore willingly part withal: except my life, except\\nmy life, except my life.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nFare you well, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nThese tedious old fools!\\nEnter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN\\n\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nYou go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\n[To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!\\nExit POLONIUS\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nMy honoured lord!\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nMy most dear lord!\\nHAMLET\\nMy excellent good friends! How dost thou,\\nGuildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nAs the indifferent children of the earth.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nHappy, in that we are not over-happy;\\nOn fortune's cap we are not the very button.\\nHAMLET\\nNor the soles of her shoe?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nNeither, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nThen you live about her waist, or in the middle of\\nher favours?\\nGUILDENSTERN\\n'Faith, her privates we.\\nHAMLET\\nIn the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she\\nis a strumpet. What's the news?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nNone, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.\\nHAMLET\\nThen is doomsday near: but your news is not true.\\nLet me question more in particular: what have you,\\nmy good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,\\nthat she sends you to prison hither?\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nPrison, my lord!\\nHAMLET\\nDenmark's a prison.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nThen is the world one.\\nHAMLET\\nA goodly one; in which there are many confines,\\nwards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nWe think not so, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing\\neither good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me\\nit is a prison.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nWhy then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too\\nnarrow for your mind.\\nHAMLET\\nO God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count\\nmyself a king of infinite space, were it not that I\\nhave bad dreams.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nWhich dreams indeed are ambition, for the very\\nsubstance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.\\nHAMLET\\nA dream itself is but a shadow.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nTruly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a\\nquality that it is but a shadow's shadow.\\nHAMLET\\nThen are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and\\noutstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we\\nto the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.\\nROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN\\nWe'll wait upon you.\\nHAMLET\\nNo such matter: I will not sort you with the rest\\nof my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest\\nman, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the\\nbeaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nTo visit you, my lord; no other occasion.\\nHAMLET\\nBeggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I\\nthank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are\\ntoo dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it\\nyour own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,\\ndeal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nWhat should we say, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent\\nfor; and there is a kind of confession in your looks\\nwhich your modesties have not craft enough to colour:\\nI know the good king and queen have sent for you.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nTo what end, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nThat you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by\\nthe rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of\\nour youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved\\nlove, and by what more dear a better proposer could\\ncharge you withal, be even and direct with me,\\nwhether you were sent for, or no?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\n[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?\\nHAMLET\\n[Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you\\nlove me, hold not off.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nMy lord, we were sent for.\\nHAMLET\\nI will tell you why; so shall my anticipation\\nprevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king\\nand queen moult no feather. I have of late--but\\nwherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all\\ncustom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily\\nwith my disposition that this goodly frame, the\\nearth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most\\nexcellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave\\no'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted\\nwith golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to\\nme than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.\\nWhat a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!\\nhow infinite in faculty! in form and moving how\\nexpress and admirable! in action how like an angel!\\nin apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the\\nworld! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,\\nwhat is this quintessence of dust? man delights not\\nme: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling\\nyou seem to say so.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nMy lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.\\nHAMLET\\nWhy did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nTo think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what\\nlenten entertainment the players shall receive from\\nyou: we coted them on the way; and hither are they\\ncoming, to offer you service.\\nHAMLET\\nHe that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty\\nshall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight\\nshall use his foil and target; the lover shall not\\nsigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part\\nin peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose\\nlungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall\\nsay her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt\\nfor't. What players are they?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nEven those you were wont to take delight in, the\\ntragedians of the city.\\nHAMLET\\nHow chances it they travel? their residence, both\\nin reputation and profit, was better both ways.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nI think their inhibition comes by the means of the\\nlate innovation.\\nHAMLET\\nDo they hold the same estimation they did when I was\\nin the city? are they so followed?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nNo, indeed, are they not.\\nHAMLET\\nHow comes it? do they grow rusty?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nNay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but\\nthere is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,\\nthat cry out on the top of question, and are most\\ntyrannically clapped for't: these are now the\\nfashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they\\ncall them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of\\ngoose-quills and dare scarce come thither.\\nHAMLET\\nWhat, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are\\nthey escoted? Will they pursue the quality no\\nlonger than they can sing? will they not say\\nafterwards, if they should grow themselves to common\\nplayers--as it is most like, if their means are no\\nbetter--their writers do them wrong, to make them\\nexclaim against their own succession?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\n'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and\\nthe nation holds it no sin to tarre them to\\ncontroversy: there was, for a while, no money bid\\nfor argument, unless the poet and the player went to\\ncuffs in the question.\\nHAMLET\\nIs't possible?\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nO, there has been much throwing about of brains.\\nHAMLET\\nDo the boys carry it away?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nAy, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.\\nHAMLET\\nIt is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of\\nDenmark, and those that would make mows at him while\\nmy father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an\\nhundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.\\n'Sblood, there is something in this more than\\nnatural, if philosophy could find it out.\\nFlourish of trumpets within\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nThere are the players.\\nHAMLET\\nGentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,\\ncome then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion\\nand ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,\\nlest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,\\nmust show fairly outward, should more appear like\\nentertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my\\nuncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nIn what, my dear lord?\\nHAMLET\\nI am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is\\nsoutherly I know a hawk from a handsaw.\\nEnter POLONIUS\\n\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nWell be with you, gentlemen!\\nHAMLET\\nHark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a\\nhearer: that great baby you see there is not yet\\nout of his swaddling-clouts.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nHappily he's the second time come to them; for they\\nsay an old man is twice a child.\\nHAMLET\\nI will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;\\nmark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;\\n'twas so indeed.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nMy lord, I have news to tell you.\\nHAMLET\\nMy lord, I have news to tell you.\\nWhen Roscius was an actor in Rome,--\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nThe actors are come hither, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nBuz, buz!\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nUpon mine honour,--\\nHAMLET\\nThen came each actor on his ass,--\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nThe best actors in the world, either for tragedy,\\ncomedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,\\nhistorical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-\\ncomical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or\\npoem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor\\nPlautus too light. For the law of writ and the\\nliberty, these are the only men.\\nHAMLET\\nO Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nWhat a treasure had he, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nWhy,\\n'One fair daughter and no more,\\nThe which he loved passing well.'\\nLORD POLONIUS\\n[Aside] Still on my daughter.\\nHAMLET\\nAm I not i' the right, old Jephthah?\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nIf you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter\\nthat I love passing well.\\nHAMLET\\nNay, that follows not.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nWhat follows, then, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nWhy,\\n'As by lot, God wot,'\\nand then, you know,\\n'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--\\nthe first row of the pious chanson will show you\\nmore; for look, where my abridgement comes.\\nEnter four or five Players\\n\\nYou are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad\\nto see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old\\nfriend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:\\ncomest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young\\nlady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is\\nnearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the\\naltitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like\\napiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the\\nring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en\\nto't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:\\nwe'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste\\nof your quality; come, a passionate speech.\\nFirst Player\\nWhat speech, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nI heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was\\nnever acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the\\nplay, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas\\ncaviare to the general: but it was--as I received\\nit, and others, whose judgments in such matters\\ncried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well\\ndigested in the scenes, set down with as much\\nmodesty as cunning. I remember, one said there\\nwere no sallets in the lines to make the matter\\nsavoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might\\nindict the author of affectation; but called it an\\nhonest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very\\nmuch more handsome than fine. One speech in it I\\nchiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and\\nthereabout of it especially, where he speaks of\\nPriam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin\\nat this line: let me see, let me see--\\n'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--\\nit is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--\\n'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,\\nBlack as his purpose, did the night resemble\\nWhen he lay couched in the ominous horse,\\nHath now this dread and black complexion smear'd\\nWith heraldry more dismal; head to foot\\nNow is he total gules; horridly trick'd\\nWith blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\\nBaked and impasted with the parching streets,\\nThat lend a tyrannous and damned light\\nTo their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,\\nAnd thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,\\nWith eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\\nOld grandsire Priam seeks.'\\nSo, proceed you.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\n'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and\\ngood discretion.\\nFirst Player\\n'Anon he finds him\\nStriking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,\\nRebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\\nRepugnant to command: unequal match'd,\\nPyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;\\nBut with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\\nThe unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\\nSeeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\\nStoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\\nTakes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,\\nWhich was declining on the milky head\\nOf reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:\\nSo, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,\\nAnd like a neutral to his will and matter,\\nDid nothing.\\nBut, as we often see, against some storm,\\nA silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\\nThe bold winds speechless and the orb below\\nAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\\nDoth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,\\nAroused vengeance sets him new a-work;\\nAnd never did the Cyclops' hammers fall\\nOn Mars's armour forged for proof eterne\\nWith less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword\\nNow falls on Priam.\\nOut, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,\\nIn general synod 'take away her power;\\nBreak all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\\nAnd bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\\nAs low as to the fiends!'\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nThis is too long.\\nHAMLET\\nIt shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,\\nsay on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he\\nsleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.\\nFirst Player\\n'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'\\nHAMLET\\n'The mobled queen?'\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nThat's good; 'mobled queen' is good.\\nFirst Player\\n'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames\\nWith bisson rheum; a clout upon that head\\nWhere late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\\nAbout her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,\\nA blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;\\nWho this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,\\n'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have\\npronounced:\\nBut if the gods themselves did see her then\\nWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\\nIn mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,\\nThe instant burst of clamour that she made,\\nUnless things mortal move them not at all,\\nWould have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,\\nAnd passion in the gods.'\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nLook, whether he has not turned his colour and has\\ntears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.\\nHAMLET\\n'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.\\nGood my lord, will you see the players well\\nbestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for\\nthey are the abstract and brief chronicles of the\\ntime: after your death you were better have a bad\\nepitaph than their ill report while you live.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nMy lord, I will use them according to their desert.\\nHAMLET\\nGod's bodykins, man, much better: use every man\\nafter his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?\\nUse them after your own honour and dignity: the less\\nthey deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.\\nTake them in.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nCome, sirs.\\nHAMLET\\nFollow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.\\nExit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First\\n\\nDost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the\\nMurder of Gonzago?\\nFirst Player\\nAy, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nWe'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,\\nstudy a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which\\nI would set down and insert in't, could you not?\\nFirst Player\\nAy, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nVery well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him\\nnot.\\nExit First Player\\n\\nMy good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are\\nwelcome to Elsinore.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nGood my lord!\\nHAMLET\\nAy, so, God be wi' ye;\\nExeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN\\n\\nNow I am alone.\\nO, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\\nThat from her working all his visage wann'd,\\nTears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,\\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\\nWith forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!\\nFor Hecuba!\\nWhat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do,\\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\\nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears\\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech,\\nMake mad the guilty and appal the free,\\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze indeed\\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,\\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,\\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\\nAnd can say nothing; no, not for a king,\\nUpon whose property and most dear life\\nA damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?\\nWho calls me villain? breaks my pate across?\\nPlucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?\\nTweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,\\nAs deep as to the lungs? who does me this?\\nHa!\\n'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be\\nBut I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall\\nTo make oppression bitter, or ere this\\nI should have fatted all the region kites\\nWith this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!\\nRemorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!\\nO, vengeance!\\nWhy, what an ass am I! This is most brave,\\nThat I, the son of a dear father murder'd,\\nPrompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,\\nMust, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,\\nAnd fall a-cursing, like a very drab,\\nA scullion!\\nFie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard\\nThat guilty creatures sitting at a play\\nHave by the very cunning of the scene\\nBeen struck so to the soul that presently\\nThey have proclaim'd their malefactions;\\nFor murder, though it have no tongue, will speak\\nWith most miraculous organ. I'll have these players\\nPlay something like the murder of my father\\nBefore mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;\\nI'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,\\nI know my course. The spirit that I have seen\\nMay be the devil: and the devil hath power\\nTo assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps\\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,\\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,\\nAbuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds\\nMore relative than this: the play 's the thing\\nWherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.\\nExit\\n\\n\""

Rashly,\\nAnd praised be rashness for it, let us know,\\nOur indiscretion sometimes serves us well,\\nWhen our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us\\nThere's a divinity that shapes our ends,\\nRough-hew them how we will,--\\nHORATIO\\nThat is most certain.\\nHAMLET\\nUp from my cabin,\\nMy sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark\\nGroped I to find out them; had my desire.\\nFinger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew\\nTo mine own room again; making so bold,\\nMy fears forgetting manners, to unseal\\nTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--\\nO royal knavery!--an exact command,\\nLarded with many several sorts of reasons\\nImporting Denmark's health and England's too,\\nWith, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,\\nThat, on the supervise, no leisure bated,\\nNo, not to stay the grinding of the axe,\\nMy head should be struck off.\\nHORATIO\\nIs't possible?\\nHAMLET\\nHere's the commission: read it at more leisure.\\nBut wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?\\nHORATIO\\nI beseech you.\\nHAMLET\\nBeing thus be-netted round with villanies,--\\nEre I could make a prologue to my brains,\\nThey had begun the play--I sat me down,\\nDevised a new commission, wrote it fair:\\nI once did hold it, as our statists do,\\nA baseness to write fair and labour'd much\\nHow to forget that learning, but, sir, now\\nIt did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know\\nThe effect of what I wrote?\\nHORATIO\\nAy, good my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nAn earnest conjuration from the king,\\nAs England was his faithful tributary,\\nAs love between them like the palm might flourish,\\nAs peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear\\nAnd stand a comma 'tween their amities,\\nAnd many such-like 'As'es of great charge,\\nThat, on the view and knowing of these contents,\\nWithout debatement further, more or less,\\nHe should the bearers put to sudden death,\\nNot shriving-time allow'd.\\nHORATIO\\nHow was this seal'd?\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, even in that was heaven ordinant.\\nI had my father's signet in my purse,\\nWhich was the model of that Danish seal;\\nFolded the writ up in form of the other,\\nSubscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,\\nThe changeling never known. Now, the next day\\nWas our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent\\nThou know'st already.\\nHORATIO\\nSo Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, man, they did make love to this employment;\\nThey are not near my conscience; their defeat\\nDoes by their own insinuation grow:\\n'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes\\nBetween the pass and fell incensed points\\nOf mighty opposites.\\nHORATIO\\nWhy, what a king is this!\\nHAMLET\\nDoes it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--\\nHe that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,\\nPopp'd in between the election and my hopes,\\nThrown out his angle for my proper life,\\nAnd with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,\\nTo quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,\\nTo let this canker of our nature come\\nIn further evil?\\nHORATIO\\nIt must be shortly known to him from England\\nWhat is the issue of the business there.\\nHAMLET\\nIt will be short: the interim is mine;\\nAnd a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'\\nBut I am very sorry, good Horatio,\\nThat to Laertes I forgot myself;\\nFor, by the image of my cause, I see\\nThe portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.\\nBut, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me\\nInto a towering passion.\\nHORATIO\\nPeace! who comes here?\\nEnter OSRIC\\n\\nOSRIC\\nYour lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.\\nHAMLET\\nI humbly thank you, sir.

Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.\\nOSRIC\\nI thank your lordship, it is very hot.\\nHAMLET\\nNo, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is\\nnortherly.\\nOSRIC\\nIt is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.\\nHAMLET\\nBut yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my\\ncomplexion.\\nOSRIC\\nExceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as\\n'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his\\nmajesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a\\ngreat wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--\\nHAMLET\\nI beseech you, remember--\\nHAMLET moves him to put on his hat\\n\\nOSRIC\\nNay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.\\nSir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe\\nme, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent\\ndifferences, of very soft society and great showing:\\nindeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or\\ncalendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the\\ncontinent of what part a gentleman would see.\\nHAMLET\\nSir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;\\nthough, I know, to divide him inventorially would\\ndizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw\\nneither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the\\nverity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of\\ngreat article; and his infusion of such dearth and\\nrareness, as, to make true diction of him, his\\nsemblable is his mirror; and who else would trace\\nhim, his umbrage, nothing more.\\nOSRIC\\nYour lordship speaks most infallibly of him.\\nHAMLET\\nThe concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman\\nin our more rawer breath?\\nOSRIC\\nSir?\\nHORATIO\\nIs't not possible to understand in another tongue?\\nYou will do't, sir, really.\\nHAMLET\\nWhat imports the nomination of this gentleman?\\nOSRIC\\nOf Laertes?\\nHORATIO\\nHis purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.\\nHAMLET\\nOf him, sir.\\nOSRIC\\nI know you are not ignorant--\\nHAMLET\\nI would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,\\nit would not much approve me. Well, sir?\\nOSRIC\\nYou are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--\\nHAMLET\\nI dare not confess that, lest I should compare with\\nhim in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to\\nknow himself.\\nOSRIC\\nI mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation\\nlaid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.\\nHAMLET\\nWhat's his weapon?\\nOSRIC\\nRapier and dagger.\\nHAMLET\\nThat's two of his weapons: but, well.\\nOSRIC\\nThe king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary\\nhorses: against the which he has imponed, as I take\\nit, six French rapiers and poniards, with their\\nassigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the\\ncarriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very\\nresponsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,\\nand of very liberal conceit.\\nHAMLET\\nWhat call you the carriages?\\nHORATIO\\nI knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.\\nOSRIC\\nThe carriages, sir, are the hangers.\\nHAMLET\\nThe phrase would be more german to the matter, if we\\ncould carry cannon by our sides: I would it might\\nbe hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses\\nagainst six French swords, their assigns, and three\\nliberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet\\nagainst the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?\\nOSRIC\\nThe king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes\\nbetween yourself and him, he shall not exceed you\\nthree hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it\\nwould come to immediate trial, if your lordship\\nwould vouchsafe the answer.\\nHAMLET\\nHow if I answer 'no'?\\nOSRIC\\nI mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.\\nHAMLET\\nSir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his\\nmajesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let\\nthe foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the\\nking hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;\\nif not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.\\nOSRIC\\nShall I re-deliver you e'en so?\\nHAMLET\\nTo this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.\\nOSRIC\\nI commend my duty to your lordship.\\nHAMLET\\nYours, yours.\\nExit OSRIC\\n\\nHe does well to commend it himself; there are no\\ntongues else for's turn.\\nHORATIO\\nThis lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.\\nHAMLET\\nHe did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.\\nThus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I\\nknow the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of\\nthe time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of\\nyesty collection, which carries them through and\\nthrough the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do\\nbut blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.\\nEnter a Lord\\n\\nLord\\nMy lord, his majesty commended him to you by young\\nOsric, who brings back to him that you attend him in\\nthe hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to\\nplay with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.\\nHAMLET\\nI am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's\\npleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now\\nor whensoever, provided I be so able as now.\\nLord\\nThe king and queen and all are coming down.\\nHAMLET\\nIn happy time.\\nLord\\nThe queen desires you to use some gentle\\nentertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.\\nHAMLET\\nShe well instructs me.\\nExit Lord\\n\\nHORATIO\\nYou will lose this wager, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nI do not think so: since he went into France, I\\nhave been in continual practise: I shall win at the\\nodds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here\\nabout my heart: but it is no matter.\\nHORATIO\\nNay, good my lord,--\\nHAMLET\\nIt is but foolery; but it is such a kind of\\ngain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.\\nHORATIO\\nIf your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will\\nforestall their repair hither, and say you are not\\nfit.\\nHAMLET\\nNot a whit, we defy augury: there's a special\\nprovidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,\\n'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be\\nnow; if it be not now, yet it will come: the\\nreadiness is all: since no man has aught of what he\\nleaves, what is't to leave betimes?\\nEnter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, & c\\n\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nCome, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.\\nKING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's\\n\\nHAMLET\\nGive me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;\\nBut pardon't, as you are a gentleman.\\nThis presence knows,\\nAnd you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd\\nWith sore distraction.

Never Hamlet:\\nIf Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,\\nAnd when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,\\nThen Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.\\nWho does it, then? His madness: if't be so,\\nHamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;\\nHis madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.\\nSir, in this audience,\\nLet my disclaiming from a purposed evil\\nFree me so far in your most generous thoughts,\\nThat I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,\\nAnd hurt my brother.\\nLAERTES\\nI am satisfied in nature,\\nWhose motive, in this case, should stir me most\\nTo my revenge: but in my terms of honour\\nI stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,\\nTill by some elder masters, of known honour,\\nI have a voice and precedent of peace,\\nTo keep my name ungored.

Something have you heard\\nOf Hamlet's transformation; so call it,\\nSith nor the exterior nor the inward man\\nResembles that it was. What it should be,\\nMore than his father's death, that thus hath put him\\nSo much from the understanding of himself,\\nI cannot dream of: I entreat you both,\\nThat, being of so young days brought up with him,\\nAnd sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,\\nThat you vouchsafe your rest here in our court\\nSome little time: so by your companies\\nTo draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,\\nSo much as from occasion you may glean,\\nWhether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,\\nThat, open'd, lies within our remedy.\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nGood gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;\\nAnd sure I am two men there are not living\\nTo whom he more adheres.

But what might you think,\\nWhen I had seen this hot love on the wing--\\nAs I perceived it, I must tell you that,\\nBefore my daughter told me--what might you,\\nOr my dear majesty your queen here, think,\\nIf I had play'd the desk or table-book,\\nOr given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,\\nOr look'd upon this love with idle sight;\\nWhat might you think? No, I went round to work,\\nAnd my young mistress thus I did bespeak:\\n'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;\\nThis must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,\\nThat she should lock herself from his resort,\\nAdmit no messengers, receive no tokens.\\nWhich done, she took the fruits of my advice;\\nAnd he, repulsed--a short tale to make--\\nFell into a sadness, then into a fast,\\nThence to a watch, thence into a weakness,\\nThence to a lightness, and, by this declension,\\nInto the madness wherein now he raves,\\nAnd all we mourn for.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nDo you think 'tis this?\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nIt may be, very likely.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nHath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--\\nThat I have positively said 'Tis so,'\\nWhen it proved otherwise?\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nNot that I know.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\n[Pointing to his head and shoulder]\\nTake this from this, if this be otherwise:\\nIf circumstances lead me, I will find\\nWhere truth is hid, though it were hid indeed\\nWithin the centre.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nHow may we try it further?\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nYou know, sometimes he walks four hours together\\nHere in the lobby.\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nSo he does indeed.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nAt such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:\\nBe you and I behind an arras then;\\nMark the encounter: if he love her not\\nAnd be not from his reason fall'n thereon,\\nLet me be no assistant for a state,\\nBut keep a farm and carters.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nWe will try it.\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nBut, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nAway, I do beseech you, both away:\\nI'll board him presently.\\nExeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants\\n\\nEnter HAMLET, reading\\n\\nO, give me leave:\\nHow does my good Lord Hamlet?\\nHAMLET\\nWell, God-a-mercy.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nDo you know me, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nExcellent well; you are a fishmonger.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nNot I, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nThen I would you were so honest a man.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nHonest, my lord!\\nHAMLET\\nAy, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be\\none man picked out of ten thousand.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nThat's very true, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nFor if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a\\ngod kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nI have, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nLet her not walk i' the sun: conception is a\\nblessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.\\nFriend, look to 't.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\n[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my\\ndaughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I\\nwas a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and\\ntruly in my youth I suffered much extremity for\\nlove; very near this. I'll speak to him again.\\nWhat do you read, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nWords, words, words.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nWhat is the matter, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nBetween who?\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nI mean, the matter that you read, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nSlanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here\\nthat old men have grey beards, that their faces are\\nwrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and\\nplum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of\\nwit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,\\nthough I most powerfully and potently believe, yet\\nI hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for\\nyourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab\\nyou could go backward.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\n[Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method\\nin 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nInto my grave.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nIndeed, that is out o' the air.\\nAside\\n\\nHow pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness\\nthat often madness hits on, which reason and sanity\\ncould not so prosperously be delivered of. I will\\nleave him, and suddenly contrive the means of\\nmeeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable\\nlord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.\\nHAMLET\\nYou cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will\\nmore willingly part withal: except my life, except\\nmy life, except my life.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nFare you well, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nThese tedious old fools!\\nEnter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN\\n\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nYou go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\n[To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!\\nExit POLONIUS\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nMy honoured lord!\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nMy most dear lord!\\nHAMLET\\nMy excellent good friends! How dost thou,\\nGuildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nAs the indifferent children of the earth.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nHappy, in that we are not over-happy;\\nOn fortune's cap we are not the very button.\\nHAMLET\\nNor the soles of her shoe?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nNeither, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nThen you live about her waist, or in the middle of\\nher favours?\\nGUILDENSTERN\\n'Faith, her privates we.\\nHAMLET\\nIn the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she\\nis a strumpet. What's the news?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nNone, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.\\nHAMLET\\nThen is doomsday near: but your news is not true.\\nLet me question more in particular: what have you,\\nmy good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,\\nthat she sends you to prison hither?\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nPrison, my lord!\\nHAMLET\\nDenmark's a prison.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nThen is the world one.\\nHAMLET\\nA goodly one; in which there are many confines,\\nwards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nWe think not so, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing\\neither good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me\\nit is a prison.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nWhy then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too\\nnarrow for your mind.\\nHAMLET\\nO God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count\\nmyself a king of infinite space, were it not that I\\nhave bad dreams.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nWhich dreams indeed are ambition, for the very\\nsubstance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.\\nHAMLET\\nA dream itself is but a shadow.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nTruly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a\\nquality that it is but a shadow's shadow.\\nHAMLET\\nThen are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and\\noutstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we\\nto the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.\\nROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN\\nWe'll wait upon you.\\nHAMLET\\nNo such matter: I will not sort you with the rest\\nof my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest\\nman, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the\\nbeaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nTo visit you, my lord; no other occasion.\\nHAMLET\\nBeggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I\\nthank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are\\ntoo dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it\\nyour own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,\\ndeal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nWhat should we say, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent\\nfor; and there is a kind of confession in your looks\\nwhich your modesties have not craft enough to colour:\\nI know the good king and queen have sent for you.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nTo what end, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nThat you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by\\nthe rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of\\nour youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved\\nlove, and by what more dear a better proposer could\\ncharge you withal, be even and direct with me,\\nwhether you were sent for, or no?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\n[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?\\nHAMLET\\n[Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you\\nlove me, hold not off.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nMy lord, we were sent for.\\nHAMLET\\nI will tell you why; so shall my anticipation\\nprevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king\\nand queen moult no feather. I have of late--but\\nwherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all\\ncustom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily\\nwith my disposition that this goodly frame, the\\nearth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most\\nexcellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave\\no'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted\\nwith golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to\\nme than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.\\nWhat a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!\\nhow infinite in faculty! in form and moving how\\nexpress and admirable! in action how like an angel!\\nin apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the\\nworld! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,\\nwhat is this quintessence of dust? man delights not\\nme: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling\\nyou seem to say so.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nMy lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.\\nHAMLET\\nWhy did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nTo think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what\\nlenten entertainment the players shall receive from\\nyou: we coted them on the way; and hither are they\\ncoming, to offer you service.\\nHAMLET\\nHe that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty\\nshall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight\\nshall use his foil and target; the lover shall not\\nsigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part\\nin peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose\\nlungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall\\nsay her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt\\nfor't. What players are they?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nEven those you were wont to take delight in, the\\ntragedians of the city.\\nHAMLET\\nHow chances it they travel? their residence, both\\nin reputation and profit, was better both ways.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nI think their inhibition comes by the means of the\\nlate innovation.\\nHAMLET\\nDo they hold the same estimation they did when I was\\nin the city? are they so followed?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nNo, indeed, are they not.\\nHAMLET\\nHow comes it? do they grow rusty?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nNay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but\\nthere is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,\\nthat cry out on the top of question, and are most\\ntyrannically clapped for't: these are now the\\nfashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they\\ncall them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of\\ngoose-quills and dare scarce come thither.\\nHAMLET\\nWhat, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are\\nthey escoted? Will they pursue the quality no\\nlonger than they can sing? will they not say\\nafterwards, if they should grow themselves to common\\nplayers--as it is most like, if their means are no\\nbetter--their writers do them wrong, to make them\\nexclaim against their own succession?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\n'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and\\nthe nation holds it no sin to tarre them to\\ncontroversy: there was, for a while, no money bid\\nfor argument, unless the poet and the player went to\\ncuffs in the question.\\nHAMLET\\nIs't possible?\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nO, there has been much throwing about of brains.\\nHAMLET\\nDo the boys carry it away?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nAy, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.\\nHAMLET\\nIt is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of\\nDenmark, and those that would make mows at him while\\nmy father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an\\nhundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.\\n'Sblood, there is something in this more than\\nnatural, if philosophy could find it out.\\nFlourish of trumpets within\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nThere are the players.\\nHAMLET\\nGentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,\\ncome then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion\\nand ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,\\nlest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,\\nmust show fairly outward, should more appear like\\nentertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my\\nuncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nIn what, my dear lord?\\nHAMLET\\nI am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is\\nsoutherly I know a hawk from a handsaw.\\nEnter POLONIUS\\n\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nWell be with you, gentlemen!\\nHAMLET\\nHark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a\\nhearer: that great baby you see there is not yet\\nout of his swaddling-clouts.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nHappily he's the second time come to them; for they\\nsay an old man is twice a child.\\nHAMLET\\nI will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;\\nmark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;\\n'twas so indeed.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nMy lord, I have news to tell you.\\nHAMLET\\nMy lord, I have news to tell you.\\nWhen Roscius was an actor in Rome,--\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nThe actors are come hither, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nBuz, buz!\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nUpon mine honour,--\\nHAMLET\\nThen came each actor on his ass,--\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nThe best actors in the world, either for tragedy,\\ncomedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,\\nhistorical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-\\ncomical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or\\npoem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor\\nPlautus too light. For the law of writ and the\\nliberty, these are the only men.\\nHAMLET\\nO Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nWhat a treasure had he, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nWhy,\\n'One fair daughter and no more,\\nThe which he loved passing well.'\\nLORD POLONIUS\\n[Aside] Still on my daughter.\\nHAMLET\\nAm I not i' the right, old Jephthah?\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nIf you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter\\nthat I love passing well.\\nHAMLET\\nNay, that follows not.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nWhat follows, then, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nWhy,\\n'As by lot, God wot,'\\nand then, you know,\\n'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--\\nthe first row of the pious chanson will show you\\nmore; for look, where my abridgement comes.\\nEnter four or five Players\\n\\nYou are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad\\nto see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old\\nfriend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:\\ncomest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young\\nlady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is\\nnearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the\\naltitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like\\napiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the\\nring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en\\nto't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:\\nwe'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste\\nof your quality; come, a passionate speech.\\nFirst Player\\nWhat speech, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nI heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was\\nnever acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the\\nplay, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas\\ncaviare to the general: but it was--as I received\\nit, and others, whose judgments in such matters\\ncried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well\\ndigested in the scenes, set down with as much\\nmodesty as cunning. I remember, one said there\\nwere no sallets in the lines to make the matter\\nsavoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might\\nindict the author of affectation; but called it an\\nhonest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very\\nmuch more handsome than fine. One speech in it I\\nchiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and\\nthereabout of it especially, where he speaks of\\nPriam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin\\nat this line: let me see, let me see--\\n'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--\\nit is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--\\n'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,\\nBlack as his purpose, did the night resemble\\nWhen he lay couched in the ominous horse,\\nHath now this dread and black complexion smear'd\\nWith heraldry more dismal; head to foot\\nNow is he total gules; horridly trick'd\\nWith blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\\nBaked and impasted with the parching streets,\\nThat lend a tyrannous and damned light\\nTo their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,\\nAnd thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,\\nWith eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\\nOld grandsire Priam seeks.'\\nSo, proceed you.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\n'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and\\ngood discretion.\\nFirst Player\\n'Anon he finds him\\nStriking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,\\nRebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\\nRepugnant to command: unequal match'd,\\nPyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;\\nBut with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\\nThe unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\\nSeeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\\nStoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\\nTakes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,\\nWhich was declining on the milky head\\nOf reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:\\nSo, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,\\nAnd like a neutral to his will and matter,\\nDid nothing.\\nBut, as we often see, against some storm,\\nA silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\\nThe bold winds speechless and the orb below\\nAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\\nDoth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,\\nAroused vengeance sets him new a-work;\\nAnd never did the Cyclops' hammers fall\\nOn Mars's armour forged for proof eterne\\nWith less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword\\nNow falls on Priam.\\nOut, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,\\nIn general synod 'take away her power;\\nBreak all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\\nAnd bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\\nAs low as to the fiends!'\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nThis is too long.\\nHAMLET\\nIt shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,\\nsay on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he\\nsleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.\\nFirst Player\\n'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'\\nHAMLET\\n'The mobled queen?'\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nThat's good; 'mobled queen' is good.\\nFirst Player\\n'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames\\nWith bisson rheum; a clout upon that head\\nWhere late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\\nAbout her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,\\nA blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;\\nWho this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,\\n'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have\\npronounced:\\nBut if the gods themselves did see her then\\nWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\\nIn mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,\\nThe instant burst of clamour that she made,\\nUnless things mortal move them not at all,\\nWould have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,\\nAnd passion in the gods.'\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nLook, whether he has not turned his colour and has\\ntears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.\\nHAMLET\\n'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.\\nGood my lord, will you see the players well\\nbestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for\\nthey are the abstract and brief chronicles of the\\ntime: after your death you were better have a bad\\nepitaph than their ill report while you live.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nMy lord, I will use them according to their desert.\\nHAMLET\\nGod's bodykins, man, much better: use every man\\nafter his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?\\nUse them after your own honour and dignity: the less\\nthey deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.\\nTake them in.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nCome, sirs.\\nHAMLET\\nFollow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.\\nExit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First\\n\\nDost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the\\nMurder of Gonzago?\\nFirst Player\\nAy, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nWe'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,\\nstudy a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which\\nI would set down and insert in't, could you not?\\nFirst Player\\nAy, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nVery well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him\\nnot.\\nExit First Player\\n\\nMy good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are\\nwelcome to Elsinore.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nGood my lord!\\nHAMLET\\nAy, so, God be wi' ye;\\nExeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN\\n\\nNow I am alone.\\nO, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\\nThat from her working all his visage wann'd,\\nTears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,\\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\\nWith forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!\\nFor Hecuba!\\nWhat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do,\\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\\nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears\\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech,\\nMake mad the guilty and appal the free,\\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze indeed\\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,\\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,\\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\\nAnd can say nothing; no, not for a king,\\nUpon whose property and most dear life\\nA damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?\\nWho calls me villain? breaks my pate across?\\nPlucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?\\nTweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,\\nAs deep as to the lungs? who does me this?\\nHa!\\n'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be\\nBut I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall\\nTo make oppression bitter, or ere this\\nI should have fatted all the region kites\\nWith this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!\\nRemorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!\\nO, vengeance!\\nWhy, what an ass am I! This is most brave,\\nThat I, the son of a dear father murder'd,\\nPrompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,\\nMust, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,\\nAnd fall a-cursing, like a very drab,\\nA scullion!\\nFie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard\\nThat guilty creatures sitting at a play\\nHave by the very cunning of the scene\\nBeen struck so to the soul that presently\\nThey have proclaim'd their malefactions;\\nFor murder, though it have no tongue, will speak\\nWith most miraculous organ. I'll have these players\\nPlay something like the murder of my father\\nBefore mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;\\nI'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,\\nI know my course. The spirit that I have seen\\nMay be the devil: and the devil hath power\\nTo assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps\\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,\\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,\\nAbuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds\\nMore relative than this: the play 's the thing\\nWherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.\\nExit\\n\\n\"}"
